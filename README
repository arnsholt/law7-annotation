As with any researcher software, this has not been tested on a wide variety of
platforms. It's known to work on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) and RHEL 6. If you
have trouble getting things to run, contact me at arnsholt@gmail.com.

Software you'll need:
- GNU Make
- bash
- GNU AWK
- R
- Perl 5.12 or greater
    - Lingua::CoNLLX, available from https://github.com/arnsholt/Lingua-CoNLLX

If you want to train parsers, you'll also need MaltParser. The Makefile
assumes that MaltParser is run with a script called "malt". If you don't have
such a script, run this instead:
    MALT="java -jar /path/to/maltparser.jar" make models/norwegian.mco
